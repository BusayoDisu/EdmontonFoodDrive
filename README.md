### PROJECT TITLE: "Predictive Optimization of Food Bank Donation Drive Efficiency in Edmonton: A Machine Learning Approach Based on Volunteer and Collection Data"

### Problem Statement

"The current Food Bank Donation Drive in Edmonton faces operational challenges in efficiently managing volunteer resources and optimizing collection processes. The lack of a predictive system to estimate the time spent on the drive, considering factors such as the number of adult and youth volunteers, donation bags collected, routes completed, doors in route, and bags per door or route, hinders effective planning and resource allocation". 

### Solution
"This project aims to address these challenges by developing machine learning models that predict the time spent to complete the drive, providing actionable insights for improved efficiency and resource optimization in Edmonton's Food Bank Donation Drive."
